I worked on Five fascinating projects:

Task 1- Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning: Built a Python-based spam detector using machine learning algorithms, allowing for accurate classification of emails as spam or non-spam.

Task 2- Unemployment Analysis with Python: Conducted an in-depth analysis of the unemployment rate, focusing on the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. Explored trends and factors affecting unemployment to gain valuable insights into the job market and the broader economy.

Task 3- Iris Flower Classification: Trained a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers based on their measurements, enhancing our understanding of different Iris species and their distinct characteristics.

Task 4- Car price Prediction with machine learning : Implemented a car price prediction model using linear regression and lasso regression. Prioritized influential features, managed multicollinearity, and prevented overfitting with lasso regularization, resulting in accurate and interpretable predictions.

Task 5-Sales Predictions:The sales prediction project successfully forecasted future sales using Python, demonstrating its effectiveness in predictive analytics.**
